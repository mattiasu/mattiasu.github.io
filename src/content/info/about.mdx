# About

Hi, I'm Mattias Uhlegård. I'm a software engineer by heart, currently working in leadership roles around enterprise architecture, developer experience, and change journeys to building great software.

For most of my career, I’ve focused on building strong teams, solving complex problems, and helping companies become better at software. I’ve spent more time shipping outcomes than building a public profile — but this is my attempt to share some of what I’ve learned along the way.

I write here about modern enterprise architecture, engineering leadership, open source in regulated environments, and how to change traditional organizations into software-capable companies.

All opinions are my own. Always open to feedback or conversation — you’ll find me at `mattiasu.dev@uhlegard.se`.
