# About

Hi, I'm Mattias Uhlegård. I'm a software engineer by heart, currently working in leadership roles around architecture, developer experience, and change journeys to building great software.

For most of my career, I’ve focused on building strong teams, addressging complex business and organisational problems, and helping companies become better at software. I’ve spent more time shipping outcomes than building a public profile. This is my attempt to share some of what I’ve learned along the way.

I write here about things I've learnt, failed at, perspectives I've gained, and more.

All opinions are my own. Always open to feedback or conversation — you’ll find me at `mattias@uhlegard.se`.

> I tend to use 👍 a lot — maybe to stay positive, maybe to soften tough feedback. Either way, I believe in clarity, kindness, and keeping things moving in conversations.
